      Link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wikitude&hl=en
Step2:Search IIT-AR in the search section and select it.

Step3:After the camera shows up, point it in any direction and it will show all the landmarks or placemarks in that direction.

We are hoping that by using the AR World we created, people new to IIT-Delhi are able to navigate throught the University 
easily and get better education.
